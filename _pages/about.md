I\'m Kai Lu, currently a postdoctoral fellow at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). My major is storage systems and techniques. I\'m in Parallel Data Storage Lab ([PSDL](https://github.com/PDS-Lab)) led by Prof. Jiguang Wan and Prof. Changsheng Xie. PDSL has long been devoted to the research of distributed storage systems, key-value storage and AI storage.
